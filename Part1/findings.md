* Vulnerable Cryptographic Primitives:
  * [CWE-1240](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1240.html): Use of a Cryptographic Primitive with a Risky Implementation
    * [CVE-2020-4778](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-4778): Usage of MD5 algorithm for hashing token in a single instance which is less safe than the default SHA-256 algorithm.
    * [CVE-2019-3907](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-3907): Storage of user credentials and other sensitive information with a known weak encryption method (MD5 hash of a salt and password).
    * [CVE-2021-34687](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-34687): Personal key is transmitted over the network using a substitution cipher.
    * [CVE-2020-6616](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-6616): Chip implementing Bluetooth uses a low-entropy PRNG instead of a hardware RNG, allowing spoofing.
