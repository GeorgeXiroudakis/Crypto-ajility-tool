          Blowfish is a block cipher developed by Bruce Schneier. It is known to be susceptible to attacks   
          when using weak keys.  The author has recommended that users of Blowfish move to newer algorithms  
          such as AES. With the `cryptography` package it is recommended to use `Fernet` which is a secure   
          implementation of AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key.  Alternatively, keep using the `Cipher` class
          from the hazmat primitives but use the AES algorithm instead.

          IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm) is a block cipher created in 1991.  It is an optional
          component of the OpenPGP standard. This cipher is susceptible to attacks when using weak keys.  It  
          is recommended that you do not use this cipher for new applications. Use a strong symmetric cipher  
          such as EAS instead. With the `cryptography` package it is recommended to use `Fernet` which is a   
          secure implementation of AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key.  Alternatively, keep using the `Cipher`
          class from the hazmat primitives but use the AES algorithm instead.
